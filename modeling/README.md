This folder contains the files for approaches to clustering as a proxy for modeling semantic extensions of nominal classifiers.

This folder currently contains two files:

1. modeling.py : The main callable file to run modeling.
2. util.py : Ancillary utilities to support modeling, such as retrieving the correct versions of models and clustering method objects.
